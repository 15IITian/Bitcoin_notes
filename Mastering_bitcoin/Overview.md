 - #### Change Output-> 
    - get back change
    - When you make a Bitcoin transaction, you create outputs that specify where the bitcoins are going. Each output has an address associated with it.
    - In the Bitcoin protocol, whether you're sending bitcoins to someone else or sending the remaining bitcoins back to yourself (known as change), there's no technical difference.
    - **changeless transactions** -> bitcoin spend= bitcoin avaliable - fees
#### Coin Selection -> 
  *  wallets use different strategies when choosing which inputs to use in a payment,
  *   Unless the wallet can aggregate inputs in such a way to exactly match the desired payment plus transaction fees, the wallet will need to generate some change. This is very similar to how people handle cash.
  #### Forms of Transcation -> 
   - **Simple Payment** ->

 - Even if Alice's wallet app is offline, it can still create transactions. This is because the wallet already knows which bitcoins she owns and can prepare the transaction offline -> can spend to network after online.
